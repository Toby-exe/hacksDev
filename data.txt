Mount Royal University has carved out a distinct niche by offering smaller class sizes, a robust liberal education and unique undergraduate programs. Founded in 1910 and located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Mount Royal grew into a vibrant college in the 1930s and became a mid-sized university with a greater focus on bachelor degrees in 2009.
Mount Royal University believes talented and committed employees are the driving force behind student success, and Indigenous People have the right to meaningful access to quality post-secondary education. While most of our students come to Mount Royal from within Calgary and the surrounding region, we believe in providing a flexible and collaborative learning experience provincially, nationally and internationally. More than 90,000 Mount Royal alumni are contributing to their communities worldwide.
The Lincoln Park campus offers an exceptional experience for students, employees and visitors. We want to reduce our environmental impact and maintain a safe and welcoming campus. Community members are invited to come to our campus to take non-credit courses, enjoy recreation facilities, see a performance, take a music class at the Conservatory, rent space, use conference services or access Libraryâ€™s resources.
